## General info
This project is a web app that visualises data from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). 
The app lets you navigate through Star Wars movies, characters and planets and discover details about them. It makes use of master-detail relationships in order to navigate from one element to the other.

SW uses media queries for mobile responsiveness.
The forms that let you fill in information about new elements are for demonstration purposes as the API does not offer this functionality.
